Hello, 
The purpose of this project is creating a dashboard for the sales team 
this dashboard will give an overview where users can get a better understanding of their sales, see their month to month peformance, selet a currency
and see how it compares to other currencies 


In this project i went througha couple of steps : 
* 1: importing the data to Power Bi 
* 2: Transforming it ( deleted all null columns, extracted a username column out of the eamil column , NB: the middle name column have a couple of null values but also 
have filled attributes so i just left it as it is in the dim_customer)
* 3: Created my measure Table 
* 4: created a dim_date using DAX Query language
* 5: cretaed my measures (total sales amount , total sales amount all , measures for dynamic titlebars, measure for selected currencies ...)
* 6: cretated my visuals 
  NB: the TIMELINE SCLICER is not available on power bi so i imported it from the microsoft website but you can find it in this directory 
* 7: created my bookmarks for each state of the lists (On and Off bookmarks for each button)
